          <p>If you get prescriptions for something other than HRT medicine, a <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs/prescription-prepayment-certificates-ppcs">Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC) that covers all NHS prescriptions</a> may be better for you.</a></p>

      <p>
        If you pay for NHS prescribed HRT medicine 3 or more times in 12 months, an HRT PPC could save you money.<br><br>
        
        Each item on an NHS prescription usually costs £9.35. You can buy an HRT PPC for a one-off payment of £18.70 (the cost of two items). <br><br>This covers you for an unlimited number of certain HRT prescriptions for 12 months.

        <h3>Before you start</h3>

        <p>You'll need to:</P>

        <ul>
          <li>check if you are exempt from paying prescription charges using our <a href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/check-my-nhs-exemption/start">Check if you have an NHS exemption service</a></li>
          <li>find the name of your medicine on your HRT medicine packaging or prescription</li>
          <li>have a valid credit or debit card to pay for the HRT PPC</li>
        </ul>


       




<h3>About your HRT PPC</h3>
        
<p>If you are applying on behalf of someone else, fill in the application using their details rather than your own.</p>
       
        
      
        <p>You can choose the start date of your HRT PPC. This can be up to one calendar month before or after the date you buy it. </p>
        <p>As the HRT PPC is only being introduced from 1 April 2023 you will not be able to backdate it to before this date.</p>
