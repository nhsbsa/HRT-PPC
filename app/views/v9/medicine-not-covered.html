          The HRT medicine you need is not currently covered by an HRT PPC. More medicines may be added in the future once they become licensed. 
        <br><br>Depending on how often you collect your prescriptions, a <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs/nhs-prescription-prepayment-certificates-ppcs" target="_blank">Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC)</a> may still save you money.
