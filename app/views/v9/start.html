        </h3>
        <p>Not all Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) medicine is covered by an HRT Prescription Prepayment Certificate (HRT PPC). It's important to <a href="/drugs">check your HRT medicine is covered </a> before purchasing this certificate.<br><br>
          
          If your HRT medicine is not covered, or you need a prescription for something other than HRT, a different <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs/prescription-prepayment-certificates-ppcs" target="_blank">Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC)</a> may be better for you.</a></p>

      <h3>About your HRT PPC</h3>
      <p>
        If you need more than 2 prescriptions within 12 months, an HRT PPC will save you money.<br><br>
        
        Each item on an NHS prescription usually costs £9.35.
        You can buy an HRT PPC for a one-off debit or credit card payment of £18.70 (the cost of two prescriptions). <br><br>This covers you for an unlimited number of HRT prescriptions for 12 months.  


      
      
        

      
   

<div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
  <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
  <p>After buying an HRT PPC, you can claim a refund for any HRT prescriptions paid for in the last 30 days, but you must have a <a href="https://faq.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/knowledgebase/category/?articlecategory=Refund%20of%20prescription%20charges%20and%20FP57s&id=CAT-01105" target="_blank">refund form</a> for each prescription.</p>
